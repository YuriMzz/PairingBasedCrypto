Raw data of experiments:

A copy of the RELIC configuration has been saved with related experimental data for
reproducibility purpose

In the latter 2 folders there are 2 subfolders, for the average and the
worst case scenario (W); in the compact subfolder data have been aggregated in order
to generate summary plots. 
The aggregation have been done by hand, with the help of VSCode search & replace tool;
it could have been done using a script, but it was not worth the effort at that time.

The plot subfolders contains the plots genrated using python
